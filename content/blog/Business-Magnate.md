## What Is Social Proof

Social proof, a term coined by Robert Cialdini in his 1984 book, Influence, is also known as informational social influence. It describes a psychological and social phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in an attempt to undertake behaviour in a given situation.

Social proof is considered prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate mode of behaviour, and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation.

The effects of social influence can be seen in the tendency of large groups to conform to choices which are either correct or mistaken. This is referred to in some publications as the herd behaviour. Although social proof reflects a rational motive to take into account the information possessed by others, formal analysis shows that it can cause people to converge too quickly upon a single distinct choice, so that decisions of even larger groups of individuals may be grounded in very little information (see information cascades).

Social proof is one type of conformity. When a person is in a situation where they are unsure of the correct way to behave, they will often look to others for clues concerning the correct behaviour. When “we conform because we believe that others’ interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and will help us choose an appropriate course of action”,it is informational social influence. This is contrasted with normative social influence wherein a person conforms to be liked or accepted by others.

Social proof often leads not only to public compliance (conforming to the behaviour of others publicly without necessarily believing it is correct) but also private acceptance (conforming out of a genuine belief that others are correct).Social proof is more powerful when being accurate is more important and when others are perceived as especially knowledgeable.

## The Different Types Of Social Proof

1. Expert: When industry experts recommends your product or service.
2. Celebrity Endorsement: When a celebrity endorses your product or service.
3. User: User testimonials and reviews.
4. Certifications: This type of social proof is when you are given a stamp of approval by an authoritative figure in your industry. Examples: the blue checkmark on Twitter or Facebook.
5. “Wisdom of the Crowds”: This type of social proof is when a large group of people is seen to be endorsing your brand.
6. “Wisdom of your Friends”: When people see their friends using your product or service

I will be going into more detail about each of these in later articles.

### Which Type Is The Best

There is no evidence that one is better than the other. IMO they are all as equally as important. Here are some facts about social proof:

88% of consumers trust user reviews as much as personal recommendations. Placing the logos of business customers on a company website can increase conversions by as much as 400%, according to Voices.com.

Influencer marketing has been considered the fastest-growing consumer-acquisition channel.

The average consumer reads 10 online reviews before making a purchase decision.

57% of consumers will only buy or use a business service if it has at least a 4-star rating.

For 50% of all consumers, their very next step after reading a positive review about a company is to visit their website.
